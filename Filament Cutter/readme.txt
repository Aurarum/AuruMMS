This filament cutter is designed to be used in cases when mounting a cutter arm is not feasible.
The cutter is fairly lightweight and is only around 55g so not huge increase in weight.
It uses LA-T8-12-15-10/65-64 or similar linear actuator that are widley available.
Quick release push fittings are 5mm in diameter - this can be changed in the design though.
You will need 3mm long M2.5 heat set inserts to reduce the wear and tear on the bracket when the filament is being cut.
You will need to use No11 craft blade - snip off the very pointy end so it doesn't stick out and poke you.
the part could be made bigger to hide it, but hey - aren't we chasing miligrams :)
The actutor is controlled by either 12V or 24V. backwards and forwards motion is achieved by swapping polarity on the actuator.
This could be done by using heater output on the controller board coupled with a two way relay.
Cutter cuts through even tough PLA that is much harder to cut then something like PETG, ABS and similar
